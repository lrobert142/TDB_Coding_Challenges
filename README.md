Coding Challenges set by TBD Design
---
1) I have attached a ZIP file containing a PSD for a basic landing page. If you open the file, you’ll see everything has been named and grouped in to the relevant folders. The top layer includes a folder titled ‘Modal’ for the pop up email form. You’re required to convert this file to a working responsive front-end that has an email form (bonus if the submissions can be stored somewhere). *Please supply working & compiled files*

2) Create a basic wordpress install that has two Custom Post Types. One titled Animals and one titled Vets. Add 10 posts with placeholder content under both of these CPT’s. Create a template page that displays 5 posts from each category on the same page. (this can use a default wordpress theme). 

3) Using the Pokemon API and Bootstrap, display 10 Pokemon on a single html page with their name, weight, abilities and moves. *Image optional*
